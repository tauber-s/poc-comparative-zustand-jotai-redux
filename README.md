# Exploring State Management Libraries: Redux, Zustand, and Jotai

This project was created as a hands-on exploration of three popular state management libraries in the React ecosystem â€” **Redux**, **Zustand**, and **Jotai**. The goal was to understand their APIs, capabilities, and performance characteristics.

## Features

- âœ… **Theme Switcher**  
  A global theme toggle was implemented using each library to compare how state can be shared across components.

- ðŸ“Š **Benchmark Comparison**  
  A simple performance benchmark was created to compare how each library handles frequent state updates.  
  > *Result:* No noticeable performance differences were observed in this scenario.

- ðŸ§ª **Highlighted Features**  
  Demonstrated and tested features I found particularly useful in Zustand and Jotai, such as:
  - Zustandâ€™s middleware and persistence utilities
  - Jotaiâ€™s atom composition and integration with localStorage

This project is meant to serve as both a learning experience and a reference for choosing the right state management solution depending on use case complexity.
